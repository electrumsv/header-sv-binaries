Overview
========

This repo has a single purpose: To compile unofficial binaries of 
BitcoinSV's HeaderSV. Namely for usage in the 
[ElectrumSV SDK](https://pypi.org/project/electrumsv-sdk) which aims
to provide a first-class RegTest developer experience for running a local
(or cloud / pipelines-based) Bitcoin Node, HeaderSV instance as well as 
other relevant services that many bitcoin applications depend on.
